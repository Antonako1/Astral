Astral is a minimalistic and efficient console UI framework designed for C99. It provides essential features for handling user input and rendering text-based interfaces without relying on the standard C library (LIBC).

## Features
- **LIBC-Free** – Runs independently of the standard C library.
- **Mouse Support** – Detects and handles mouse movements, enabling full mouse-based UI interaction.
- **Simple API** – Easy to use and integrate into existing projects.
- **Cross-Platform (In Progress)** – Currently supports Windows, with plans for additional platforms.

## Development
- Designed for easy porting to other platforms—only a handful of platform-specific functions need to be implemented.

More features and improvements are planned!
